# QuickPortScan
Quick and dirty python port scanner.

Installation instructions:
  - Run install.sh. This will copy the other files to their proper spots.
  - Run the command by using: qps [options] <destination>

I still consider this a work in progress as I have been working on this (in some way shape or form) on and off for the last year tweaking and improving on functions.
